# Justifications for rule removals:
#
# misc-include-cleaner
#  Not super accurate or useful, need to set up IWYU for better detection including forward declares.
#
# misc-no-recursion
#  Hard to work around with the Math interpretation tree, just takes some work to build it without recursion.
#
# portability-avoid-pragma-once
#  Not really useful, our supported compilers support #pragma once
#
# readability-convert-member-functions-to-static
#  Was throwing false positives
#
# readability-named-parameter
#  Gets in the way of eliding parameter names that are obvious from context, and in my opinion reduces readability in that case.

# HeaderFilterRegex is broken in some versions, see https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/133582.
# At least 20.1.2 fixes this. For now, we specify on the commandline just to ensure this option gets set.
